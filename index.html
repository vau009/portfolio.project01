           <p>Hi! I am Asraful islam, a web designer/developer focused on crafting great web experiences. Designing and Coding have been my passion since the days I started working with computers but I found myself into web design/development since 2020. I enjoy creating beautifully designed, intuitive and functional websites.</p>

                <h1>Dream Big</h1>
                <h5>Trying To Keep The Dream Alive</h5>
                <p>So as I drifted from job to job gaining valuable & diverse experience, I still managed to squeeze in a few web-design related projects into the mix. Whether it was a new website for the company I worked for, or building them an intranet, or updating their existing one, even volunteering to manage my church’s website, I managed to keep the web design dream somewhat alive.</p>
